## Usage
- The game has 2Ô∏è‚É£ players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a üé≤ as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
- But, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to "Hold", which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ points on GLOBAL score wins the game!
